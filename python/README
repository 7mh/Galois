A Prototype implementation of a Python interface for the Galois library
for parallelism in graph algorithms.
The Galois library is licensed under the three clause BSD license.
These bindings are licensed under the two clause BSD license.


Steps to run:
1. Make sure Galois library is installed:
  make && make install -j
2. Build:
  python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
3. In python interactive shell:
  >> import galois as GL
  >> GL.pagerank(2,0,b"/Users/gill/Documents/Katana/development/inputs/rmat15.tgr")
